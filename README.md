# Classic Programming Problems

A curated collection of classic programming problems implemented in Python.  
This repository is organized by topic—recursion, sorting, searching, strings, math, and more—with the goal of practicing algorithmic thinking, improving problem-solving skills, and reinforcing core computer science concepts.

## 📁 Structure

├── recursion/
├── sorting/
├── search/
├── strings/
├── math/
├── data_structures/
├── README.md


Each folder contains problems relevant to that topic. Each problem is written in a single `.py` file with comments explaining the logic.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Recursion** (e.g. Fibonacci, factorial, Tower of Hanoi)
- **Sorting algorithms** (e.g. bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort)
- **Search algorithms** (e.g. linear search, binary search)
- **String manipulation** (e.g. palindrome check, reverse, frequency counter)
- **Mathematical problems** (e.g. primes, Armstrong numbers, GCD)
- **Basic data structures** (e.g. stacks, queues)

## 🚀 Goals

- Sharpen problem-solving skills
- Practice clean and readable code
- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and logic

## ✅ How to Use

You can browse each folder to explore problems. To run a problem:

```bash
python3 path/to/problem.py

All problems are self-contained and ready to run.
